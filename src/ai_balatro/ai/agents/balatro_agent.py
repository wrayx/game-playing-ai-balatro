{poker_objectives}

ACTION INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Analyze the cards listed above (Card 0, Card 1, Card 2, etc.) with their descriptions
2. Identify the best poker hand you can form from these cards
3. Discarding cards may help you draw better cards to improve your hand, forming stronger poker hands
4. Choose ONE action:

   a) If you have a strong playable hand:
      - Use play_cards(indices=[...]) with the indices of cards to play
      - Example: play_cards(indices=[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]) to play first 5 cards
      - Example: play_cards(indices=[0, 2, 4, 6, 7]) to play specific cards
      - If you are holding 8, 8, 9, 2, 5, 10, J, Q, you should play 8, 9, 10, J, Q to form a straight, and the indices would be [0, 2, 5, 6, 7]

   b) If you need better cards:
      - Use discard_cards(indices=[...]) with the indices of cards to discard
      - Example: discard_cards(indices=[5, 6, 7]) to discard last 3 cards
      - Example: discard_cards(indices=[1, 3]) to discard specific unwanted cards
      - If you are holding 8, 10, 2, 5, 5, J, Q, K, since 8, 10, J, Q, K forms with one addition 9 a better straight, try discarding 2 and 5, the indices would be [2, 3]

   c) If you need to interact with UI:
      - Use click_button(button_type='...') for UI actions

Suits can be counted too, if you hold 3, 7, 8, J, 9, 2, 2, 4, suggesting high card but if you could identify the suits of the card, say
3 of Hearts, 7 of Hearts, 8 of Hearts, J of Hearts, 9 of Hearts, 2 of Diamonds, 2 of Clubs, 4 of Spades, this would form a flush with Hearts suit, so playing these 5 cards would be a better option.

Remember:
- Cards are indexed from 0 (Card 0 is the leftmost)
- You can only play OR discard in one action, not both
- Provide clear reasoning for your choice

Execute the best action immediately and explain your strategic reasoning."""

Most strategy comes from understanding the Texas Hold'em poker rules and making optimal plays based on the current hand and game phase.

<game_rules>
In Texas Hold'em, the poker hand rankings from highest to lowest are:

1. Royal Flush (e.g. A, K, Q, J, 10 of the same suit)
2. Straight Flush (e.g. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 of the same suit)
3. Four of a Kind (e.g. four Aces, four Kings, etc.)
4. Full House (e.g. three of a kind plus a pair)
5. Flush (e.g. any five cards of the same suit)
6. Straight (e.g. five consecutive cards of mixed suits)
7. Three of a Kind (e.g. three Aces, three Kings, etc.)
8. Two Pair (e.g. two Aces and two Kings)
9. One Pair (e.g. two Aces)
10. High Card (e.g. the highest card in hand)

It's the same in Balatro, but instead of gaming with other opponents, you are playing against a score target set by the current blind.
The deck holds 52 playing cards by default; you may add or modify cards as the run progresses.
You hold a hand of 8 cards by default and may select at most 5 of them for any single action.
Playing cards scores them and then draws replacements back up to your hand size.
Discarding cards also draws replacements back up to your hand size - that is what discards are for, they let you dig for a better hand at no score cost.
Each blind gives you a limited number of hands and discards (4 and 3 by default). Spending your last hand without reaching the target ends the run.
Scoring is not simply the rank of your hand: the hand type contributes base chips and a multiplier that grow each time that hand type is levelled up, the individual scoring cards add their own chip values, and joker cards modify chips or multiplier further. The round score is chips multiplied by the multiplier.
Your goal is therefore to reach the target score before running out of hands - not to form the most impressive poker hand. A frequently levelled modest hand backed by jokers often outscores a rarer one.

Card descriptions are read off the screen with OCR and are often garbled ('Hce of Diamonds' is the Ace of Diamonds). Each description ends with that card's chip value, which survives a bad read and narrows the rank: 11 chips is an Ace, 10 chips is a Ten or a face card, and any other number is that card's rank. Use the chip value and the suit line to recover a card whose rank word is unreadable, rather than treating it as unknown.

- Hand size: {cards_count} cards

- Available buttons: {[btn['class_name'] for btn in game_state.get('ui_buttons', [])]}

STRATEGIC OPTIONS:
1. **Play cards**: Use position array with 1s for cards to play
2. **Discard cards**: Use position array with -1s for cards to discard
3. **Hover card**: Examine specific card details first
4. **Click button**: Use available UI buttons

Choose the action that maximizes your score potential. Consider:
- Poker hand strength and scoring
- Joker synergies and multipliers
- Long-term strategy vs immediate gains
- Risk vs reward of different plays
